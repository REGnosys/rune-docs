Introducing DRR

Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR) is an open-source, cross-industry initiative led by [ISDA](https://www.isda.org/), that provides a digitalized framework for handling complex regulatory requirements. It’s based on the [Common Domain Model](https://cdm.finos.org/docs/home) initiated by [FINOS](https://www.finos.org/) and is designed to provide a standardized process overview that moves reporting away from manual interpretation toward a machine-readable format.
DRR helps financial institutions and other sectors meet their regulatory obligations efficiently and cost effectively via a common framework that can be contributed to by users, subject to review and can be updated per regime as those obligations develop. 
Financial institutions are subject to an array of global reporting obligations designed to provide transparency about their activities to regulators and ensure the safe functioning of financial markets, including the monitoring of systemic risk or market abuse.
DRR is being used by firms impacted by global trade and transaction reporting requirements.

## Benefits of using DRR
- **Consistency:** By following established design principles and a unified modelling guide, all users ensure their data meets the same regulatory standards.
- **Transparency:** The scope and status of reporting requirements are clearly defined, reducing ambiguity for modellers.
- **Efficiency:** The workflow automates the path from raw data to final regulatory projection, minimizing manual errors.
- **Compliance:** Updates can be rolled out centrally for all users and across jurisdictions.
- **Interoperability:** CDM ensures data is structured the same way across firms so everyone is using the same data standard. 

## Who’s using DRR?
