# Rune DSL modelling components

The Rune DSL can express eight types of model components. This documentation details the purpose and features of each type of model component and highlights their relationships. <br/>
Documentation for each component includes examples drawn from the [Demonstration Model](https://github.com/rosetta-models/demo), a sandbox model of the ‘vehicle’ domain.
