# 🧩 Modelling components

The Rune DSL can express eight types of model components. This documentation details the purpose and features of each type of model component and highlights their relationships. 

Documentation for each component includes examples drawn from the [Demonstration Model](https://github.com/rosetta-models/demo), a sandbox model of the ‘vehicle’ domain.



- ### [Data](./modelling-components/data.mdx)
The types and structures that define how information is stored, validated and used in code. They give shape to raw data so it can be processed logically and consistently.

- ### [Metadata](./modelling-components/metadata.mdx)
Add extra information to model elements like data types, attributes and functions, usually with a plain text description. 

- ### [Expressions (or logic)](./modelling-components/expressions.mdx)
Rune’s small, controlled set of features for expressing simple logic – basic operations, comparisons and combinations of these into larger expressions. 

- ### [Data validation (or condition)](./modelling-components/data-validation.mdx)
Components that offer a built-in ‘health check’ for your data objects, ensuring that your model stays consistent and accurate. 

- ### [Function](./modelling-components/function.mdx)
Sets of instructions that can take multiple inputs and produce a single output. 

- ### [Namespaces](./modelling-components/namespace.mdx)
These help to organise model artefacts into logical groups. They act as containers that group related components so the model is easier to understand, navigate and maintain.

- ### [Mapping (or synonym)](./modelling-components/mapping.mdx)
Defines how external documents are converted into Rune documents using synonyms.

- ### [Reporting](./modelling-components/reporting.mdx)
Reporting rules can be written as functional components in the same language used to model the business domain – a domain model. Code generators can then turn these rules into executable code that all firms can use consistently.
