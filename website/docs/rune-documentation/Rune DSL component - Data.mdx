# Rune DSL component - Data 

Data components are the types and structures that define how information is stored, validated and used in code. They give shape to raw data so it can be processed logically and consistently.

## Data component types
Within a Rune DSL data component there may be up to four types of data. Think of these as the building blocks for your data structures:
1.	**Built-in type:** The most fundamental types, like numbers and text.
2.	**Data type (complex type):** Used to describe complex business concepts (like an Engine or VehicleOwnership).
3.	**Enumeration (Enum):** A list of specific, controlled values (like PeriodEnum).
4.	**Meta-type:** (Not explicitly detailed in the provided text, but mentioned as one of the four components).

## 1. Built-in type
Built-in types are defined at the language level and are fundamental to any model – they provide the most basic way to represent information. They help to ensure consistency across all models and provide a shared vocabulary for numbers, text, time and logic. They form the foundation on which more complex types (like data types or choice types) are built.

### Syntax
Built-in data types come in three flavours:

  # Two Column Text
  <div class="two-column">
    <div>
    <h3>a. Basic types</h3>
      
       
These are your standard, non-composite data types:

     
    </div>
    <div>
  <li>int: Integer numbers </li>
  <li>number: Decimal numbers </li>
  <li>boolean: True or false values </li>
  <li>string: Text values </li>
  <li>time: Simple time values (e.g. "05:00:00")</li>
    </div>
  </div>

 <div class="two-column">
    <div>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <li>Step 3</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <img src="/img/docusaurus-social-card.jpg" alt="Social Card" />
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>


 <div class="two-column">
    <div>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <li>Step 3</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <img src="/img/docusaurus-social-card.jpg" alt="Social Card" />
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
