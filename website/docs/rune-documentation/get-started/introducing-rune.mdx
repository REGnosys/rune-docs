# 🧭 Introducing Rune
Refer to the [Overview](./overview.mdx) to find out why Rune was developed and how it’s used to define data, behaviors and processes in the finance industry. This page shows you how to get started with Rune. 


## 1. Sign up to GitHub
All Rune code, components and files live in an open-source GitHub repository. You’ll need access to this to start using Rune. 
If you don't already have one, open a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
Go to the [Rune code repository](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl/) on the FINOS hub. All the basic code you need for Rune is here, as well as more advanced features like plugins, code generators and testing tools. 

## 2. Learn Rune DSL
Get to know how Rune works by reading our [Modelling components documentation](../rune-dsl-modelling-components). 
•	This documentation gives you a full breakdown of the eight types of **modelling components** you’ll use (e.g. data, metadata, expressions etc).
•	It includes conceptual explanations of **domain modelling**, showing how data and logic combine into a coherent business model.
•	Examples drawn from demonstration models will help you understand how real-world financial processes are represented.
•	Guidance on how to structure models will help you execute them in Rosetta for **automated regulatory reporting**.
•	You can use our [**Keyword search**]( ./keyword-search) to find specific functions within the documentation.


## 3. Set up a local development environment
The [Rosetta platform](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/) is the official open-source SDK for working with Rune DSL. Once you’re signed up (for free) you’ll have access to a workspace, navigation tools, and the ability to create, edit, and validate Rune models as you build them.
Rune is not exclusive to Rosetta, however, and you can set up your own environment using the [Rune code repository](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl/). 


## 4. Contribute to the documentation
You can do your bit to make our Rune documentation even better for users. See anything that's incorrect? Or have a suggestion to make the documentation better? 
Submit your request or suggestion as a [Pull Request](../resources/faqs#how-do-I-make-a-pull-request-to-change-the-rune-documentation). We'll review it and let you know if we need more information.
Thank you in advance!
