# Rune glossary

**API** – Application Programming Interface –bridges that let different software systems talk to each other.

**Boolean** – Data type with only two values (yes/no, on/off etc).

**Cardinality** – The number of elements in a set or other grouping, as a property of that grouping.

**CSV** – Comma-Separated Values. Simple file format used to store tabular data (like spreadsheets or databases) in plain text.

**CDE** – Critical Data Element

**CDM** – Common Domain Model. A standardised, machine-readable and machine-executable blueprint for how financial products are traded and managed across the transaction lifecycle. It is represented as a domain model and distributed in open source.

**deep hash** – A hash value computed from all attributes of an object, including every nested or encapsulated attribute, recursively. Instead of hashing only the top‑level fields, a deep hash covers the entire object structure and incorporates every value into the final hash.

**deep path** – A way to access a shared attribute across all options of a choice type, without needing to know which option is present.

**DSL** – Domain-Specific Language – a programming language for a narrow purpose e.g. for financial regulatory reporting.

**E-notation** – Exponential notation is a shorthand way to write very large or very small numbers, representing them as a number multiplied by a power of 10, with the "E" standing for "times ten to the power of" (e.g. 2.5 times 10 to the power of 6 becomes 2.5E6). 

**FINOS** – Fintech Open Source Foundation

**FPML** – Financial Products Markup Language

**I/O** – input/output ****

**JSON** – JavaScript Object Notation. Text-based, language-independent format with key-value pairs (eg Name: Dave).

**PR** – Pull request

**PRG** – Peer review group

**Recursion** – A method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

**Rosetta** – REGnosys’s proprietary platform for building and sharing financial models.

**Rune DSL** – A Domain Specific Language for defining business rules, data structures, and calculations in financial and regulatory contexts. Used in Rosetta.

**SDK** – Software Development Kit – a set of tools for building software.

**XML** – Extensible Markup Language. Text-based format used to store and transport data in a structured way that both humans and machines can read.
