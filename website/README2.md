# Rune DSL documentation 

Rune DSL is an open-source, domain-specific language (DSL) designed to make financial market processes consistent, interoperable and easier to implement. It separates business logic from technical code, generates executable programs automatically, and empowers both developers and non-technical experts (like compliance teams) to contribute directly. 

The Rune DSL documentation includes:
- [A practical introduction to start using Rune](./docs/rune-documentation/get-started/introducing-rune.mdx)
- [An overview of Rune - what it does and the benefits it offers](./docs/rune-documentation/get-started/overview.mdx)
- [A breakdown of eight modelling components - how they work and what they do](./docs/rune-documentation/modelling-components)
- [Additional resources including rune keywords, FAQs and glossary](./docs/rune-documentation/resources)

  
Changes to the docs are on the [Rune DSL documentation website](https://rune-docs.netlify.app/)
