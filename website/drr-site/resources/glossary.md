**deep hash** – A hash value computed from all attributes of an object, including every nested or encapsulated attribute, recursively. Instead of hashing only the top‑level fields, a deep hash covers the entire object structure and incorporates every value into the final hash.

**deep path** – A way to access a shared attribute across all options of a choice type, without needing to know which option is present.

**DRR** – Digital Regulatory Reporting. An industry‑developed, machine‑executable interpretation of regulatory rules that produces consistent, transparent and fully traceable reporting outputs from standardised CDM data.

**DSL** – Domain-Specific Language – a programming language for a narrow purpose e.g. for financial regulatory reporting.

**E-notation** – Exponential notation is a shorthand way to write very large or very small numbers, representing them as a number multiplied by a power of 10, with the "E" standing for "times ten to the power of" (e.g. 2.5 times 10 to the power of 6 becomes 2.5E6). 

**ESMA** – European Securities and Markets Authority – EU‑level regulator responsible for securities markets, including EMIR reporting.

**FCA** – Financial Conduct Authority – United Kingdom regulator overseeing financial markets, conduct, and reporting obligations.

**Recursion** – A method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

**root type** – A root type is the top level entity (parent) from which all other entities (child types) descend. It’s the entry point and highest node in a model’s structure and acts as a container that defines the scope of the dataset.

**Rosetta** – REGnosys’s proprietary platform used as an execution engine for DRR.

**Rune DSL** – The domain-specific language built on Java that DRR uses for its logic. 

**SDK** – Software Development Kit. A packaged set of tools that helps developers build software for a specific platform, service or framework.
