# Introducing DRR

**Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR)** is an open-source, cross-industry initiative led by the [International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)](https://www.isda.org/) that transforms complex regulatory rules into clear, machine executable logic. Instead of relying on lengthy rulebooks, firm specific interpretations, and manual processes, DRR expresses reporting requirements in a shared, transparent format built on the Common Domain Model (CDM) initiated by the [Fintech Open Source Foundation (FINOS)](https://www.finos.org/). 

It’s designed to provide a **standardized process overview** that moves reporting away from manual interpretation toward a machine-readable format. This creates a single, authoritative representation of what each rule means and how it should be applied, removing ambiguity from the reporting process.

### Consistent and transparent
DRR reduces interpretation risk, eliminates duplicated implementation effort and provides a shared logic base that can be reused across jurisdictions. Because the rules are written once and executed consistently everywhere, firms don’t have to maintain their own bespoke reporting engines or reconcile differences between internal systems, vendors and trade repositories. DRR also accelerates onboarding for new regulations, since teams can build on existing patterns and reusable components.

For regulators and the wider market, DRR delivers cleaner, more comparable data. When every participant applies the same logic, supervisory analysis becomes more reliable and systemic risks become easier to detect. The transparency of the model – every rule visible, versioned and reviewable – supports stronger governance and clearer communication between industry and regulators. 

In short, DRR replaces fragmented interpretations with a **shared, executable source of truth** that raises the quality and efficiency of regulatory reporting across the entire ecosystem.

## Benefits of using DRR
- **Consistency:** By following established design principles and a unified modelling guide, all users ensure their data meets the same regulatory standards and that they're 100% best practice aligned.
- **Transparency:** The scope and status of reporting requirements are clearly defined, reducing ambiguity for modellers.
- **Efficiency:** The workflow automates the path from raw data to final regulatory projection, minimizing manual errors.
- **Compliance:** Updates can be rolled out centrally for all users and across jurisdictions.
- **Interoperability:** CDM ensures data is structured the same way across firms so everyone is using the same data standard.
- **Reduced cost:** Integrating open-source solutions can save significantly on IT expenditure.

## Development roadmap
As an open-source initiative, DRR is constantly evolving, with practical augmentations and rigorously tested developments forming an intrinsic part of the initiative.
There are several Working Groups which oversee developments across DRR. Each  owns its Roadmap, facilitated by the Chair. The Steering WG oversees the process and the integration across Working Groups.
