# 🧭 Get started
Refer to the [Rosetta platform’s website](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/rosetta/rosetta-products/0-welcome-to-rosetta/) to find out how to set up your first workspace and navigate the environment. Rosetta uses the models you write in the programming language Rune DSL to generate consistent, machine-readable representations of financial products and processes.

## What Rune DSL is
- Rune DSL is a **domain specific language (DSL)** for modelling operational processes in the financial markets industry.
- It’s a language that expresses **both data and logic** – so you model not just **what** information exists, but **how** it behaves and how rules apply to it.
- It was built to support the **Common Domain Model (CDM)**, developed by FINOS, a standardized, machine-readable blueprint for representing financial products and trades in a single, consistent digital language across the industry.
- It’s designed to be human-readable, so that domain experts without programming experience can write fully functional regulatory logic directly – a bit like in Excel.

## How it can help you
- Rune ensures **consistency and interoperability** across systems by giving you a single, precise way to define financial data and processes.
- It makes your models **machine executable**, so regulatory logic can be run automatically rather than interpreted manually.
- It allows you to encode regulatory rules, transformations and validations directly into the model – so there’s less chance of ambiguity and implementation errors.
- It integrates seamlessly with the **Rosetta** platform, enabling automated workflows for regulatory reporting, data validation and code generation.
- It helps you build models that are **transparent, auditable and reusable** – all essential for regulatory compliance.

## What the documentation covers
- This documentation gives you a full breakdown of the eight types of **modelling components** you’ll use (e.g. data, metadata, expressions etc).
- It includes conceptual explanations of **domain modelling**, showing how data and logic combine into a coherent business model.
- Examples drawn from demonstration models will help you understand how real-world financial processes are represented.
- Guidance on how to structure models will help you execute them in Rosetta for **automated regulatory reporting**.


After you've set up your workspace on [Rosetta](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/rosetta/rosetta-products/0-welcome-to-rosetta/), you're ready to start getting to know the [modelling components](../rune-dsl-modelling-components). Or use our [keyword search](./keyword-search) to research a particular element of a component.
