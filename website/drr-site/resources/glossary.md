# DRR glossary

**ARM** – Approved Reporting Mechanism

**API** – Application Programming Interface –bridges that let different software systems talk to each other.

**Boolean** – Data type with only two values (yes/no, on/off etc).

**Cardinality** – The number of elements in a set or other grouping, as a property of that grouping.

**CSV** – Comma-Separated Values. Simple file format used to store tabular data (like spreadsheets or databases) in plain text.

**CDE** – Critical Data Element

**CDM** – Common Domain Model. A standardised, machine-readable and machine-executable blueprint for how financial products are traded and managed across the transaction lifecycle. It is represented as a domain model and distributed in open source.

**deep hash** – A hash value computed from all attributes of an object, including every nested or encapsulated attribute, recursively. Instead of hashing only the top‑level fields, a deep hash covers the entire object structure and incorporates every value into the final hash.

**deep path** – A way to access a shared attribute across all options of a choice type, without needing to know which option is present.

**DRR** – Digital Regulatory Reporting. An industry‑developed, machine‑executable interpretation of regulatory rules that produces consistent, transparent and fully traceable reporting outputs from standardised CDM data.

**DSL** – Domain-Specific Language – a programming language for a narrow purpose e.g. for financial regulatory reporting.

**E-notation** – Exponential notation is a shorthand way to write very large or very small numbers, representing them as a number multiplied by a power of 10, with the "E" standing for "times ten to the power of" (e.g. 2.5 times 10 to the power of 6 becomes 2.5E6). 

**FINOS** – Fintech Open Source Foundation. A nonprofit organization that brings together the global financial services industry to collaboratively build open‑source software, standards, and best practices. 

**FpML** – Financial Products Markup Language

**GLEIF** – Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation. A not‑for‑profit organization, established by the Financial Stability Board in 2014, that is responsible for supporting and overseeing the global Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) system.

**I/O** – input/output

**ISDA** – International Swaps and Derivatives Association. The global trade association for participants in the derivatives markets.

**JSON** – JavaScript Object Notation. Text-based, language-independent format with key-value pairs (eg Name: Dave).

**LEI** – Legal Entity Identifier. A 20‑character alphanumeric code, based on the ISO 17442 standard, that provides a unique and globally recognized identity for legal entities involved in financial transactions. 

**MIC** – Market Identifier Code. A unique four‑character alphanumeric code, defined by the ISO 10383 standard, that identifies stock exchanges, trading venues, and other market facilities used in global securities trading.

**PR** – Pull request

**PRG** – Peer review group

**Recursion** – A method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

**root type** – A root type is the top level entity (parent) from which all other entities (child types) descend. It’s the entry point and highest node in a model’s structure and acts as a container that defines the scope of the dataset.

**Rosetta** – REGnosys’s proprietary platform used as an execution engine for DRR.

**Rune DSL** – The domain-specific language built on Java that DRR uses for its logic. 

**TR** – trade repository

**SDK** – Software Development Kit – a set of tools for building software.

**XML** – Extensible Markup Language. Text-based format used to store and transport data in a structured way that both humans and machines can read.
