# DRR documentation
The **Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR)** open-source initiative provides a machine executable, open source model of global derivatives reporting rules. Built on the ISDA Common Domain Model (CDM), DRR turns complex regulatory text into transparent, testable and reusable logic. This documentation site is your guide to understanding, implementing and contributing to the DRR ecosystem.

DRR exists to solve a long standing industry challenge: regulatory reporting rules are written in natural language, interpreted differently across firms, and implemented inconsistently across systems. By expressing these rules in a standardised, executable form, DRR enables firms, vendors and regulators to align on a single, authoritative interpretation of reporting requirements.

DRR can reduce implementation cost, improve reporting accuracy and increase transparency across the entire regulatory reporting chain. It supports global jurisdictions, provides a shared data and process model, and allows firms to test, validate and evolve reporting logic collaboratively. With DRR, reporting becomes more predictable, more consistent and easier to maintain as regulations evolve.

At its core, DRR works by translating trade data into CDM, applying jurisdiction specific rule logic, and generating regulatory reports and projections in the required formats. This documentation will guide you through that journey – from understanding the model, to running the services, to contributing to the future of DRR.
