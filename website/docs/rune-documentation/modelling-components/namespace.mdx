Namespaces help organise model artefacts into logical groups. Think of a namespace as a **container** that groups related components so the model is easier to understand, navigate and maintain.

[^1]: Do we need to explain how to create namespaces? 

Namespaces also:
- Make the model structure clearer for users
- Allow teams to adopt only the parts they need
- Reduce disruption when parts of the model are restructured
- Map directly to the namespaces’ Group and Artefact directory structure (a.k.a. ‘GAV coordinates’), which is visible in the model editor

[^2]: What does this last bullet point mean? Can we explain it better

Namespaces are arranged in a **hierarchy**, from inner layers to outer layers. Key points about this hierarchy:
- Each layer can access (import) the layer outside it
- Outer layers can be used independently of inner layers
- A layer may contain multiple sibling namespaces, which can reference each other

### Namespace syntax
A `namespace` is defined using the namespace keyword followed by its directory path:
`namespace cdm.product.common`
Naming rules:
- All component names must be **unique within the same namespace**.
- Components inside the same namespace can refer to each other by **name only**.

To reference components in another namespace, you must either:
- Use the fully qualified name, e.g. `cdm.base.datetime.AdjustableDate`, or 
- Import the namespace.

### Importing namespaces
To access components from another namespace, use the import keyword: `import cdm.product.asset.*`
This imports **all components** in the `cdm.product.asset` namespace.
Important details:
- Only the components in the **specific layer** you import are included.
- If you need components from deeper nested namespaces, you must import each one individually.

**Example:** importing multiple namespaces. This brings in all components from the various layers under `cdm.base`:
```haskell
import cdm.base.math.*
import cdm.base.datetime.*
import cdm.base.staticdata.party.*
import cdm.base.staticdata.asset.common.*
import cdm.base.staticdata.asset.rates.*
import cdm.base.staticdata.asset.credit.*
```
You can also reference a namespace is by using an `import ... as ...` alias.

### Using namespace aliases
You can assign an alias to an imported namespace to make references shorter and clearer:

`import cdm.base.staticdata.party.* as cdmParty`

Now you can reference types from that namespace using the alias:
```haskell
type MyContainer:
  party cdmParty.Party (1..1)
```
#### Rules for aliases
- You can only alias imports that use the `*` wildcard (i.e. full namespace imports).
- When using an alias, you must prefix all referenced types with that alias.
