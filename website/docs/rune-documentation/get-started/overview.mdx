# 📘 Rune DSL overview  

Rune DSL is an open-source, domain-specific language (DSL) designed to make financial market processes consistent, interoperable and easier to implement. It separates business logic from technical code, generates executable programs automatically, and empowers both developers and non-technical experts (like compliance teams) to contribute directly. 

## What Rune DSL is
- It’s a coding language that expresses **both data and logic** – so you model not just **what** information exists, but **how** it behaves and how rules apply to it.
- It was built to support the [**Common Domain Model (CDM)**](https://www.finos.org/common-domain-model), developed by FINOS, a standardized, machine-readable blueprint for representing financial products and trades in a single, consistent digital language across the industry.
- It’s also used for the industry-wide [**Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR)**](https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/isda-digital-regulatory-reporting/) initiative led by ISDA, the open access framework for expressing regulatory reporting rules in a digital, machine executable format, which is built on the CDM.
- It’s designed to be human-readable, so that domain experts without programming experience can write fully functional regulatory logic directly – a bit like in Excel.

## How it can help you
- Rune helps tackle the problem of siloed IT systems where data and logic may be inconsistent across different applications. It ensures **consistency and interoperability** across systems by giving you a single, precise way to define financial data and processes.
- It makes your models **machine executable**, so regulatory logic can be run automatically rather than interpreted manually.
- It allows you to encode regulatory rules, transformations and validations directly into the model – so there’s less chance of ambiguity and implementation errors.
- It integrates seamlessly with the [**Rosetta**](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/) platform, enabling automated workflows for regulatory reporting, data validation and code generation.
- It helps you build models that are **transparent, auditable and reusable** – all essential for regulatory compliance.

## [Rune DSL modelling components](../rune-dsl-modelling-components)
Our modelling components make Rune easier to use by breaking down complex financial domain modelling into modular, reusable building blocks. Instead of hand crafting every data type, validation rule or reference, Rune provides a structured set of components that simplify modelling and help to ensure consistency.
* By breaking down complex financial domain modelling, our modelling components make Rune easier to use.
* They provide modular, reusable building blocks for modelling – no need to handcraft every data type, validation rule, or reference.
* Consistency across models and systems is the goal.

## [Rosetta platform](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/)
* Provides a platform for creating, editing and extending Rune models.
* Includes integration tools to help firms adopt Rune within their own systems.
* Offers a Community Edition (free web app) so industry members can experiment and collaborate, empowering both developers and non-technical experts to collaborate on regulatory and operational logic.
* Gives access to open-source modelling projects built with Rune DSL.
